# Agile Apps

For Archival Purposes. This project was created for CSE 201 at Miami University.

---

Project uses React + Webpack + Django + Django REST Framework + SQLite.

---

### Build Instructions

```cd agile-apps/server/```

Make sure you have python installed, and then run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

This command will then launch the server:

```python manage.py runserver```

---

If you have issues with the port being blocked, instead use:

```python manage.py runserver localhost:PORT```

You can change PORT to any other number (default is 8000), until you get it to run.

---

Website should now be accessible at localhost:8000 on your browser (or whatever port you chose).

NOTE: some may need to use pip3 and python3 instead of pip and python depending on your set-up.
